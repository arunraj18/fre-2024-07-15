Whack-a-Mole Game
This project implements a simple Whack-a-Mole game with some advanced features. The game includes moles and snakes that randomly appear on the game board, a timer, and a score counter. Clicking a mole increases the score, while clicking a snake ends the game.

Features
Game Board:

A 4x3 grid of blocks where moles and snakes can appear.
Blocks display a mole or snake image when they pop up.
Score Board:

Tracks and displays the player's score.
Score increments by 1 each time a mole is clicked.
Timer:

Counts down from 30 seconds.
When the timer reaches 0, the game ends and an alert is shown.
Start Button:

Resets the game board, score, and timer when clicked.
Starts the game by initiating the mole and snake intervals.
Moles:

Appear randomly every second.
Disappear after 2 seconds if not clicked.
Up to 3 moles can be active at the same time.
Snakes:

Appear randomly every 2 seconds.
If a snake is clicked, the game ends, and snakes appear on all blocks.
All intervals are cleared when the game ends.
